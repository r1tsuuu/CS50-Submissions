Specification for Website Project:

1. HTML Tags Used:
   - I used a variety of HTML tags to structure the website, including <header>, <nav>, <a>, <ul>, <li>, <div>, <form>, <input>, <button>, and <footer>.

2. CSS Properties Used:
   - The design is styled with custom CSS, using properties like background-color, font-size, margin, padding, and color to ensure a modern and cohesive look.

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - JavaScript is used to enhance user interaction, including toggling the active state of the navbar, validating the contact form, and adding small interactive elements across the site.

4. Bootstrap Components Used:
   - Bootstrap was incorporated to create a responsive layout with features like the navbar, buttons, grid system for flexible page layouts, and card components for displaying projects.

5. Design Customization:
   - I focused on a dark background with white text and blue accents for a professional, tech-oriented aesthetic. The website is fully responsive and ensures consistency across both mobile and desktop views.

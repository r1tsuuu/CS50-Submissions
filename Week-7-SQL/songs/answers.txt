I think that the "Audio Aura" that Spotify describes is a unique and interesting way to describe a person. 
If I were to calculate this, I would based more of it on the top 5-10 songs, as I believe in "Long Song Syndrome (LSS)" where a person tends to overplay a particular music until they get sick and tired of it. 
With that in mind, I would also factor the way Spotify calculates it, though with less emphasis on that part. 
Both mine and Spotify's way of calculating this might not be representative of the listener as it fails to account for human error or simply, human clumsiness. 
For example, if a person fell asleep and one music kept on playing all night then that will screw up the calculations.
